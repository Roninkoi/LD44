Worked to Death
===============

Roninkoi 2019 Ludum Dare 44

You’re an overworked Grim Reaper trying not to get fired.
Your boss has set you an ever increasing quota of souls to
claim and your family’s expenses threaten to ruin your finances.
Can you keep your salary up and pay the bills?

Featured: crazy physics and nightmarish landscapes.

Claims souls that are RED. Claiming innocent souls causes a
monetary penalty (-3). You have to meet your soul quota in
your shift, which can range from 12 hours to 24 hours. At the
end of each day you will receive money based on the number of
souls claimed and your salary. If your money can't cover your
bills or you don't meet your quota, the game ends.

There is a day/night cycle that can make recoqnizing colors
difficult. DAY = YELLOW, DAWN/DUSK = ORANGE, NIGHT = BLUE.
The levels are randomly generated.

--- Controls ---

WASD ---------- move
LEFT/RIGHT ---- turn
SPACE --------- attack (claim soul)

The game was programmed in Go using Vulkan (vulkan-go).
GLFW is used for windowing. It uses my own engine, Gorium.
